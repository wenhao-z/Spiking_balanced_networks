# Spiking_balanced_networks

This set of codes simulate a spiking balanced network. 
The feature of this network is that the recurrent connections have two parts:
1) the sparse random connections generate temporal irregularity in chaotic state;
2) the structured (translation-invariant) connections parameterizes stimulus features.

The code is mainly written in MATLAB.
