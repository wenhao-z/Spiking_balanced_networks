SUMMARY:
This program implements the model of:
A. Litwin-Kumar & B. Doiron. Slow dynamics and high variability in balanced cortical networks with clustered connections. Nature Neuroscience 15(11), 1498-1505 (2012).

REQUIREMENTS:
You will need Julia installed.  Plotting requires matplotlib, a Python plotting library, and PyPlot, a Julia interface to matplotlib.

USE:
To run the simulation, just execute the command:

julia runsim.jl

or include("runsim.jl") from a Julia interactive session.  If you have turned on plotting, then when the program is finished running it will save a raster of the output to output.png.  You should see slow dynamics in the activity of the neuron clusters.  Also note that the first five clusters are excited after t=1.5s due to an external applied input.
